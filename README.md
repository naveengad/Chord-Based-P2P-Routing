Chord  has  been  widely  used  as  a  routing  protocol  in  structured  peer-to-peer overlay networks. A   fundamental   problem   of   peer-to-peer   applications   is   to efficiently  locate  the node  that  stores  a  particular  data  item. Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. The performance  of  structured  peer-to- peer  overlay  networks  depends  on  the  routing  protocols.  The  original  algorithm however,  has  some  redundancies  which  can  be  reduced  to  further  improve performance. The goal of this project is to present an improvement strategy over the original Chord routing algorithm. We demonstrate this improvement by running an in-memory Distributed Data Grid over Chord protocol.
